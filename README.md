# 🚀 AI Research Explorer

A system to search, summarize, and explore scientific papers using LLMs, vector search, Airflow, FastAPI, and Streamlit.

## 🌟 Overview

- Users provide keywords or upload a PDF article.
- **Airflow** orchestrates:
  - 🔍 Retrieval of relevant papers (arXiv API, Semantic Scholar API)
  - 📄 Extraction of text and metadata
  - 🧠 Generation of embeddings for each paragraph
  - 🗄️ Storage in a vector database
  - 📝 Summarization and topic extraction using LLMs
- **FastAPI** serves endpoints for:
  - 🤖 Semantic queries ("papers about federated learning in IoT")
  - 📚 Returning summaries and relevant citations
- **Streamlit** provides a UI for:
  - 📤 PDF upload or topic search
  - 📰 Displaying relevant articles with direct links
  - 💬 Chat with a "Research Assistant" powered by indexed papers
  - ☁️ Keyword cloud and topic graphs

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User enters a research topic.
2. Airflow runs the pipeline:
   - Finds papers via APIs
   - Extracts content
   - Generates embeddings
   - Stores in vector DB
3. Streamlit displays:
   - List of articles with links
   - Chat for topic questions
   - General summary of the research field
4. FastAPI enables programmatic access to all features

## 💡 Why is this project great for GitHub?

- Real-world AI application with academic value
- Combines automated pipelines with a friendly interface
- Demonstrates integration of external data + NLP + vector search
- Appeals to those interested in applied AI for scientific research
- Easily expandable to multi-language or multimodal search (text + images)
